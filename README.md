------------------
This is a basic Die Roller App based on [Kotlin Basics -  Add a Button Pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-four "Add a Button")
on Android Developers website.

This is created for the students in WTech Android Bootcamp as a part of the First App Lecture, therefore the language is in Turkish.

------------------
This app uses basic Kotlin Syntax for Android. Also includes a class for the die and multiple functions to apply basic OOP guidelines. The number of die faces
can be changed with the addition of newer die face xml files.

It uses Constraint Layout with three Views which are: a Button, an ImageView and a TextView. This are accessed from the MainActivity.kt, with findViewById, to be used. 
The number on the die is determined by the Random function and the corresponding image is shown on the ImageView.

The ImageView has a 'Content Description' to ensure the app is accessible.
